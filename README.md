## Oops... Near is no longer ongoing.

We've moved to [Bookish](https://github.com/BookishLang/Bookish). It's a new programming language we are working on, however it's its own programming language. It does not compile into **C#**, and it is very secure and fast when running and compiling.

# Thank you for your support.

We appreciate all of your support, and we hope you can forward it into Bookish. Thank you.
