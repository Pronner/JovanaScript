# The `if` statement on Near

Document published on: **7/4/2022** - takes a few seconds to a minute to read.

With if statements, you are able to decide what happens if something is true or false or if something has the property or value you that expect.

## Example

```csharp

import Packages.reg;

bool NearIsCool = true;

public static func Main() {
    
    if (NearIsCool == true) {
        
        printN("true, that");
        
    }
    else {
    
        printN("near is not cool :(");
    
    }
    
}
```

It's a commonly, or extremely commonly used statement in source codes around the internet, it is very simple to use and understand as it is like saying "if a police car is behind us the outcome is: we speed away". (obviously, that is a joke)
